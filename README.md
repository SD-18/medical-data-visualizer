# Medical Data Visualizer

This is my forked version of the Medical Data Visualizer project, which is part of the "Data Analysis with Python" course on FreeCodeCamp.com. This version contains my additions to the primary python file medical_data_visualizer.py. Once I can run this project and pass the unit tests, I'll be submitting it for review so I can complete the course.


#PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS
This project analyzes and visualizes medical examination data using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
It was built to explore relationships between various health indicators such as cholesterol, glucose, and BMI, and visualize correlations through categorical and heatmap plots.
